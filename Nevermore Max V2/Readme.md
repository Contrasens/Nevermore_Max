Welcome to Nevermore Max V2. The first Max was an early Alpha. The build was complicated, sealing and installation tedious. Shortly, the new and improved version will be released.

Some key changes:

* Mid/Back Panels are now both 4mm thickness instead of 4+6mm. Same size.
* Front Panel has the same width, but has been shortened.
* Side fans are gone, GPU fan is gone. Instead, a Sanyo C70 70x20mm drives the whole unit coupled with a MG125 wing servo for carbon sealing and a 4010 for negative pressure exhaust.
* No pieces are the same :/
